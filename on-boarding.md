# On-boarding

Welcome to the Base Two team!

Every on-boarding is a little different. It's something we're constantly tweaking and improving. Any feedback, suggestions, or general thoughts you have on the matter are much appreciated. The goal is to get you feeling like a comfortable, productive member of the team.

One team member will be in charge of supervising the on-boarding process, making sure it goes as smoothly as possible. Their responsibilities [are listed below](#on-boarding-supervisor).

## New Hire First Week Activities

- Complete the typical new-job paperwork (employment agreement, tax forms, emergency contact information, etc.). See [Employee On-boarding Checklist](hhttps://b2io.slack.com/archives/C904HLD5L/p1516982459000227) for the full list
