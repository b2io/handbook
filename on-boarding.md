# On-boarding

Welcome to the Base Two team!

Every on-boarding is a little different. It's something we're constantly tweaking and improving. Any feedback, suggestions, or general thoughts you have on the matter are much appreciated. The goal is to get you feeling like a comfortable, productive member of the team.

One team member will be in charge of supervising the on-boarding process, making sure it goes as smoothly as possible. Their responsibilities [are listed below](#on-boarding-supervisor).

## New Hire First Week Activities

- Complete the typical new-job paperwork (employment agreement, tax forms, emergency contact information, etc.). See [Employee On-boarding Checklist](https://b2io.slack.com/archives/C904HLD5L/p1516982459000227) for the full list
- Review this handbook and our [Information Protection and Security Policy](information-protection-policy.md)
- Get acquainted with the [Base Two process, tools, and workflow](https://github.com/b2io/development-standards)
- Take some time to read through the documentation in the shared Google Drive folder
  - Full-time hires should add their preferred info to the [Employee Directory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-GuKTHc59Odhr40p1-0b49Nzfm1wxQhKJbna7nCGiI/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Check out the notes from the most recent [Weekly Meeting](https://b2io.slack.com/archives/C904HLD5L/p1516982531000575)
- Scroll through Slack and see what we've been talking about lately
- Add yourself to the [Base Two website](http://base2.io)
  - Open up the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/b2io/projects/15) for the Base Two website
  - Add a task such as "Add <name> to the website"
  - Assign yourself to it and move it to the "In Progress" column
  - Begin working on the task and track time to the base2.io Harvest project
- Get to know each member of the team by scheduling 1:1s with them
- Get some experience with an ongoing project:
  - Identify a project where you can shadow/pair with the team and get acclimated
  - Implement a feature/fix, go through the pull-request review process, make revisions as needed, and then ship the code to production
- Review these onboarding processes after you are settled for feedback about your experience. Is there anything that you wish you knew or were confused about?

## On-boarding Supervisor

The on-boarding supervisor is responsible for ensuring our newest team member has a smooth on-boarding experience.

### Before Day One

- Give them day-one details:
  - When to log on
  - When they can call it a day
  - That lunch will be provided on Day One (to test out the expensing process once they start!)
  - What documentation to bring (see [checklist](https://b2io.slack.com/archives/C904HLD5L/p1516982459000227))
  - What they'll be doing
- Prep on-boarding paperwork and update [on-boarding checklist](https://b2io.slack.com/archives/C904HLD5L/p1516982459000227) if necessary
- Ask them to select a machine and order it so that it arrives on the first scheduled day
- Schedule a "Just Checking" In 1-on-1 for yourself and the new hire at the one-month and two-month marks to discuss how things are progressing

### On Day One

- Arrive 15-30 minutes earlier than the designated start time
- Help them to set up their development environment if needed
- Set up a meeting with them for the majority of the morning to go through the new hire [first week activities](#new-hire-first-week-activities).

### After Day One

Attend monthly "Just Checking In" meetings with new hire to see how things are going, collect feedback, and improve on our processes.
