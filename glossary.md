Wait, what is everyone talking about?

#### **ComFest** &mdash; _Community Festival_

to be hippies. All are welcome to make the trip.

#### **Computestick** &mdash; _Thumb-drive computer_

The thumb-drive-sized computer plugged into the Columbus office TV, turning it
into a multipurpose display that we mostly use for weekly meetings. This is what drives the Base Two pro Zoom account.

#### **Lightning Talks**

Lightning Talks are casual, informal presentations we occasionally give to our co-workers. Historically, these happen on a Friday over lunch. A lightning talk can be any duration (5-30min for example), and can be of any level of preparation! Sometimes they are prepared, rehearsed, and presented with a slide deck, and other times they are just casual, group discussions with no one explicitly presenting.

They don't even have to be about tech! We've had presentations about China, Dungeons & Dragons, and more.

#### **Shout-outs** &mdash; _Positive feedback_

Portion of the weekly meeting wherein we bestow accolades upon our coworkers.

#### **Shout-ats** &mdash; _Negative feedback_

Portion of the weekly meeting that previously did not exist, but had to make a comeback due to 2020 being the year that it was.

#### **StirTrek** &mdash; _Columbus tech conference_

A Columbus tech conference that the entire Base Two team attends each year.
