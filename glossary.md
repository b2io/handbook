#### **Lightning Talks**

Lightning Talks are casual, informal presentations we occasionally give to our co-workers. Historically, these happen on a Friday over lunch. A lightning talk can be any duration (5-30min for example), and can be of any level of preparation! Sometimes they are prepared, rehearsed, and presented with a slide deck, and other times they are just casual, group discussions with no one explicitly presenting.

They don't even have to be about tech! We've had presentations about China, Dungeons & Dragons, and more.
