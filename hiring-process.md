# Hiring Process

We strive to be intentional in our hiring process. We believe very strongly in the role of a responsible, local business to fully represent the demographics of their community. This takes time and effort on our part to grow a more diverse network and we are actively taking measures to ensure that this is the case.

As we review candidates for both full time developer positions and the apprenticeship program, we consider, in depth, our current team and pipeline. What is the current makeup of our teams, where are we allocated, what are our strengths and weaknesses, and what skills besides and beyond development do we need the most.

## Who We Hire

We created the following list order to clarify, for ourselves, what we look for when we're hiring. Interesting candidates will have some combination of the following qualities:

### Developer

**Skills** &mdash; Our company revolves around skilled people. We look for candidates who will bring unique and creative perspectives to our team. For full-time hires, we look for people who are self-assured in and have enthusiasm for their craft. When we're looking for apprentices, we seek out folks who have already gotten their feet wet in the field, whether self-taught or via coding bootcamps.

**Learning** &mdash; Ours is an industry where continuous learning is not only an opportunity, but a requirement. We look for folks who are enthusiastic about staying up-to-date with the industry and learning new technologies.

**Pipeline Alignment** &mdash; We base a myriad of decisions on how they will impact our company's stability, and hiring is no exception. We are more likely to hire folks with skill sets that match up with the work we're already doing or are attempting to procure.

### Community

**External Network** &mdash; We do most of our recruiting through word-of-mouth. We are interested in candidates who have a wide network, and/or one that taps into groups we haven't yet gotten to know.

**Team Cohesion** &mdash; Ours is a very small team. We want to ensure that new hires feel comfortable talking to any of their potential teammates, and vice versa. We look for folks who are kind, empathetic, and interesting.

**Community Involvement** &mdash; We appreciate folks who are active in the tech community, whether through Meetups, user groups, teaching, conferences, or any combination of those things.

### Business

**Client relations** &mdash; When clients talk to Base Two, they are talking directly to the developers who are doing the work for them. This is one of the many things that set us apart from other businesses. Because of this, we look for candidates who are accustomed to, and skilled at, working with clients.

**Existing Connections** &mdash; Much of our business development is done by word-of-mouth. We like to see (full-time hire) candidates who have solid existing client relationships and are respected in the community.

**Wild Card** &mdash; Due to the small size of our team, most of our folks wear multiple hats. We look for candidates who - aside from being solid developers - have complimentary skills in areas like project management, business operations, marketing, design, etc.

## How We Hire

We keep track of submissions made via the [jobs page](http://base2.io/jobs) on our website. We discuss applicants, as well as people we know who might be interested, during our weekly meeting. Once we narrow the pool down to folks we are interested in talking to, we reach out to those applicants and set up a meeting (either in-person or video conference). For accommodations related to completing a job application, please contact [info@base2.io](mailto:jobs@base2.io).

We start by having a few members of the team meet a candidate, and then follow up with a whole-team meeting. In both meetings, candidates are welcome to ask questions and get a feel for the team environment. We make this handbook available publicly in part so that candidates can get a clear picture of our company during the interview process.

Offers are typically made via email. We try and be as explicit as possible about compensation, benefits, expectations, etc.
We're not into hardball negotiating; we make sincere offers based on the best information we have.
