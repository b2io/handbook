# Who we are

Base Two is a multi-city company of experienced developers working together to turn ideas into beautiful software. We work as individuals and teams with small and large companies — local and abroad — to improve processes around software development and deliver user-focused products and applications.

We strive to be a forward-thinking and constantly improving collection of knowledgeable individuals. We work together to exceed what we could do alone. Openness, honesty, and empathy are the building blocks of our culture.

## History of Base Two

Base Two was co-founded in 2011 by Drew Miller and Zack Brown. Both had gained experience working for sales-driven software consultancies and they wanted to try a different approach to consulting.

Their aim was to create sustainable, efficient, and mutually-beneficial relationships with clients. By creating transparent, honest pricing and processes, they set out to show that Base Two is an organization that delivers on its agreements and values long-term client engagements.

Having been underpaid, overworked, and underappreciated at sales-driven organizations in the past, they also hoped to create a consultancy that values its developers. Base Two was founded on the belief that having an intelligent, well-rounded, and motivated team is the most important thing; without that, everything you pitch is an empty promise.

## Our Culture

We strive to create a work environment and culture that supports and drives software developers and technical experts. We want our employees to be excited to work so that we can create exceptional technical solutions that we can be proud of.

### Motivation and Flexibility

We are a team of self-driven people built to motivate self-driven people. Rather than institute a hierarchy of managers to point employees in a direction each day, we rely on our employees to be autonomous. With that autonomy we entrust you to identify and prioritize your tasks and responsibilities, and we provide you with the flexibility to choose the best time and place to accomplish those tasks. This flexibility allows you to work within your life rather than instead of it.

### Self-Improvement

We work within an industry that is constantly changing and where it is impossible to be an expert in everything. To us, the desire for self-improvement is more important than a business card with a fancy-sounding title.

We promote a company culture that appreciates collaborative professional growth. Our code is constantly being peer reviewed by other employees via the pull request process. This process not only allows us to catch common mistakes, but it also acts as an opportunity for discussion about varying coding styles and best practices.

We typically work on smaller 2-6 month projects that use forward-leaning technologies. This allows our team to gain experience with the latest technologies in different industries. For projects that have longer durations we attempt to rotate team members so that the work does not feel stale, and so that more of the team has experience with any given project.

In addition we also provide access to online training opportunities and sponsor employee attendance at various technical conferences. We encourage community involvement through technical meetups and open source contributions.

Career growth is facilitated and tracked. Individuals meet routinely with a team member to discuss career goals, track goal progress, and discuss feedback. Our flat hierarchy means that no one has a direct manager. We are accountable to, and advocate for each other.

### Honest and Open

We operate in a very honest and collaborative manner. Everyone has the opportunity to voice their opinion on all company decisions - from the type of coffee we purchase to the appropriate salary for a potential hire. This sharing of information allows all employees to be equally informed so that we can make the best collaborative decisions as a company. With that, all employees have visibility into the company’s financials - including internally transparent salaries.

#### Transparency

Base Two is an internally transparent company. We make the majority of decisions regarding the company as a group and all employee's opinions are valued, sought after, and taken into consideration. All employees have access to the organization's financial information, including the [Base Two Salaries](https://b2io.slack.com/archives/C904HLD5L/p1516982712000070) document, which shows the team's compensation levels. We [meet once a week](./day-to-day.md#weekly-meeting) as a team to discuss a broad range of company-related topics.

#### Cost of Living Adjustments

Cost of living adjustments are applied each January based on the previous year's [Social Security COLA](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/colaseries.html). The adjustment applies to all full-time employees as of 12/31 of the previous year.

#### Raises

If a team member believes that they (or any other member of the team) deserve a raise, then it should be brought up for discussion either in Buddy meetings, small groups, the Weekly Meeting, or whichever setting feels most comfortable. These discussions have tended to be informal in the past, and focus on the value and responsibilities that the team member provides.

#### Conferences

As referenced earlier, employees are encouraged to keep up-to-date in the industry. Some conferences that employees have attended include:

- [Abstractions](https://abstractions.io/)
- [Stir Trek](https://stirtrek.com/)
- [Jamstack](https://jamstackconf.com/)
- [React Finland](https://react-finland.fi/)
- [Drupal Gov Con](https://www.drupalgovcon.org/)

#### History of Programs

This section lists things that have been tried, and are no longer policy. They can be revisited at any time.

<strong>Buddy System</strong>
Through the Buddy System, employees were paired together in order to provide a support system. Buddy System documents are transparent and [available on the shared Drive](https://b2io.slack.com/archives/C904HLD5L/p1516982662000944).

<strong>Donut meetings</strong>
(Donut)[https://www.donut.com/?ref=slackdirectory] is a Slack bot that schedules 1:1 meetings on a regular interval with random teammates, the goal being to have informal conversations and chat with people that you might not be working with on a daily basis. This petered out because we're really busy. There had been interest in picking this back up, but that conversation turned into Lightening Talks.

<strong>Lightening Talks</strong>
Implemented in late 2020, Lightening Talks are short(3-5 min) presentations given biweekly. They can be technical or non-technical. This gives employees a chance to share knowledge about technical topic, or just fun stuff. Lightening Talk info can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ozg74kY_kEdRyTWFkE-Gttj0_MrOeCIG?usp=sharing).
