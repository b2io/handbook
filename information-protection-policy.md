# Information Protection and Security Policy

## System and Network Security

It is the responsibility of all Base Two employees to ensure that their machine has ant-virus, anti-malware, and firewall software installed and fully functional in addition to up-to-date software and security patches. HTTPS should be set as the default when navigating the web, and sensitive information should never be accessed or entered on websites that are not secure. Public WiFi should be avoided when possible, and when necessary the source of the WiFi should be confirmed with the establishment prior to connection.

## Login and Passwords

Passwords should be hard to ascertain or break by using multiple letters, cases, numbers, and symbols and/or be phrases or long acronyms. Passwords should never be stored or transmitted in an unencrypted manner (such as via paper, email, message, or in a digital document). Passwords should not be shared among users. When multi-factor authentication is available it should be used. In the event of a possible system or password compromise, passwords should be changed and a supervisor should be contacted immediately to ensure that the risks have been properly analysed and mitigated, and so that all impacted clients and parties can be notified within 24 hours.

## Destruction of Sensitive Information

Sensitive information should always be stored in an encrypted way, and when the information is no longer necessary it should be fully deleted from the system (i.e. hard-deleted so that it is not retained in the trash). When getting rid of physical documents with sensitive information a shredder should be used to ensure the proper disposal of the documents. When getting rid of hardware or donating it the contents of its hard drives and storage should be completed and securely wiped.

## Security Review

It is the responsibility of all Base Two employees to review this policy on an annual basis, and make suggestions on how security measures could be improved.
