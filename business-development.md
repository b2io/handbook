# Business Development

Our team is comprised entirely of developers, which makes the business development portion of our business model an interesting one. All team members are empowered and encouraged (but not required) to seek out potential clients and pitch on behalf of the team.

The ways in which we have found work over the years runs the gamut. Some projects have come from responding to formal requests for proposals, some have been the result of word-of-mouth via other clients, and at least one was forged at a toddler's play date (ask Tony about that one).

## Talking Points

We value conversations over sales pitches. Here are a few talking points to have in your back pocket.

### How Our Developers are Different

Base Two was founded by people who had a lot of experience in other consulting firms. They saw strengths and weaknesses in the traditional model, and wanted to try something else. Our focus, instead of being sales-oriented, is on people. We feel the most valuable resource in the tech market is having the best developers and keeping them happy. We hire people who have an aptitude for learning and a passion for technology, and we create a structure that allows them to do their best work.

Developers at Base Two are not one-dimensional. In addition to being excellent at their craft, they have:

- Insight into the business
- Empathy for the problem they're trying to solve
- Innate curiosity and enthusiasm that will drive them to seek out the best solutions

### How Our Sales Process Works

We are not a sales-oriented company. We're not out there every day trying to find the next gig. In order to stay in business, our strategy is to develop _sustainable_ relationships with our clients. We make sure we're always providing value to our clients since we don't have a huge pool of leads. We're flexible at the beginning of a relationship as we figure out how best to work together with our clients, and we ask our clients to be flexible through the evolving process.

### Who We Work With

Our roster ranges from small, bootstrap startups to fortune 500 companies and everything in between. It may sound crazy for such a small team but we have 3-4 billion-dollar clients that we work with, and we also have 3-4 shoestring clients we work with. We're flexible, and we're careful with our clients' money.

## Conversation End Goal

We strive to collaboratively solve each problem with our client. Even if we're not the right return-on-the-dollar for them, how can we be helpful? Can we recommend a contractor, can we recommend other companies?
