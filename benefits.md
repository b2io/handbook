## Health Insurance

Health insurance is important, but nobody likes losing a portion of their paycheck to it. Base Two pays 100% of the premiums for employee health, vision, and dental insurance so that you don't need to worry about it. You can also choose to add your spouse and/or dependents to the plan, but Base Two does not pay for these additional premiums. You can calculate your healthcare coverage costs with this [Health Coverage Calculator](https://b2io.slack.com/archives/C904HLD5L/p1516982095000352).

## Vacation

Employees are encouraged to take an average of 3 weeks (15 days) of vacation a year in order to take a break from work, travel, and come back feeling refreshed. Since nobody likes vacation day math, our vacation policy is flexible - there is no loss of vacation days or rollovers at the end of the year. With the flexible policy, if you took a couple of long weekends earlier in the year, and then you have the opportunity to take a 3 week European vacation - do it! We don't want you to miss out on opportunities.

When planning to take vacation time we ask that you include your anticipated out of office days to [Forecast](https://forecastapp.com/715825/schedule/team), as well as to your Base Two calendar, and let the team and your active clients know of your plans. Also, as your time off approaches please remind both the Base Two team and your active clients.

## Holidays

Base Two provides 13 paid holidays in which the Base Two office will be closed.

1. New Year's Day (January 1st)
2. Martin Luther King Day (3rd Monday in January)
3. Presidents' Day (3rd Monday in February)
4. Earth Day (April 22nd or nearest work day)
5. Memorial Day (last Monday in May)
6. Independence Day (4th of July)
7. Labor Day (1st Monday in September)
8. Voting Day (November 3)
9. Veterans Day (November 11th)
10. Thanksgiving (4th Thursday in November)
11. Consumerism Day (day after Thanksgiving)
12. Christmas Eve (December 24th)
13. Christmas Day (December 25th)

If any of the holidays falls on a weekend, the closest weekday will be substituted.

In addition to these 13 holidays we also close the office for Base Two Day. Base Two was founded on August 26, 2011. To celebrate the founding of our company we take a break from day-to-day work to do a fun activity as a group each August 26th (or nearest work day).

## Sick

We all get sick. Some years are better than others, but we won't pretend to know how many days that will be. Therefore we have unlimited sick days.

There is no sense in working through a cold. Stay home, take the day off, and focus on getting better. We simply ask that you let the team know that you won't be working, and do what you can to put your co-workers in the best position to manage the work while you're out.

## Family Leave

> We need to discuss this as a team. It would be great to provide a sizeable leave (paternity/maternity/family health issues), but we need to figure out how to reduce the financial impact ([issue #1](https://github.com/b2io/handbook/issues/1))

## Bereavement

> Are there any allocations for Bereavement?

## Jury Duty

> Are there any allocations for Jury Duty?

## Voting Leave

Civic responsibility is important, and employees are encouraged to exercise their right to vote. If you need to leave during the work day to vote, please let your colleagues know.

## 401k

Saving for retirement is important, and Base Two's 401k plan provides a method to save with pre-tax money. To help with your savings Base Two contributes 3% of your salary to your Base Two 401k plan. This amount is a direct employer contribution rather than an incentive match. Therefore you are free to contribute any amount to your 401k plan without worrying about how it impacts the contribution from Base Two. There are many retirement investment vehicles out there, and we don't assume to know what's best for you.

Your Base Two 401k is administered through ADP, and it can be managed at [www.mykplan.com](http://www.mykplan.com).

## Hardware

Our tools of the trade, be they computer, keyboard, mouse, monitors, etc., are used every day. To be happy and efficient it's important that these tools are great. How one defines "great" depends on the individual employee. Therefore Base Two does not have standard-issue equipment to hand new employees, but rather allows each employee to select the equipment that will work best for them. If it makes you happy and helps you do your work then it is worth it.
