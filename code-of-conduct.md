# Code of Conduct

Openness, honesty, and empathy are the building blocks of our culture. Being excellent to each other is the ultimate goal, and we recognize that setting clear guidelines around what constitutes "being excellent" can be helpful and reassuring for all team members. With that, we've put together this Code of Conduct. As with any portion of this handbook, if you feel something is missing from this section, let's work together to update it.

## Dress Code

Base Two does not have specific rules regarding appropriate dress. There may be circumstances where employee needs to adhere to the dress regulations of a client company.

## Drug and Alcohol Policy

While Base Two does not have specific policy related to drugs and alcohol, we ask that employees use good judgment and never indulge in a way that leads to impaired performance or inappropriate behavior, endangers the safety of others, or violates the law. There may be circumstances in which an employee may be required to adhere to the drug and alcohol policy of a client company.

## Acceptable Use of Company Hardware and Internet

Computers and Internet are two of the most basic tools at our disposal as a company. We take pains to ensure that we have the best technology available to our team. With that in mind, we ask that employees use these tools respectfully and responsibly. Emails sent via any base2.io address should not contain any content that is deemed to be offensive including, but not restricted to, the use of vulgar or harassing language/images.

## Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policies

The continued success of Base Two depends heavily on its effort to effectively utilize the talents of all qualified people. Therefore, Base Two prohibits employment decisions based on race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, parental status, veteran status, military discharge status, or citizenship status, or any other protected status. All employment decisions continue to be based on individual merit, qualifications, and competence as they relate to a particular position and promotion of the principle of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action.

### How to Report an Issue

If you, as a member of our team, feel uncomfortable for any reason you should feel empowered to speak to any other team member about the situation. If the issue stems from a specific person on the team and you feel comfortable talking through it with them directly, you should. If you do not feel comfortable doing that, you can bring your concerns to another member of the team and ask for their help in resolving the matter.

### If Someone Reports an Issue to You

We are a very small team, and currently have no formal HR or Ethics group. Because of this, we rely on ourselves and each other to ensure that our workplace is safe and welcoming.

In any instance where a team member comes to you with an issue, first ask the team member if they would like you to take action. If the answer is yes:

- Commit to assisting in resolving their issue, or identify a person who can help them
- Channel your childhood [peer mediation techniques](http://www.sese.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Peer-Mediation-guide.pdf)
- Act as an unbiased third party
- Strive for confidentiality as much as possible

We don't have much of a formal system, it's something we are continuing to create and refine as a team. If you have ideas, do not hesitate to share them.

## Workplace Behavior Guidelines
