# Day-to-day

## General Expectations

Your work and activities may change day-to-day, but there are general expectations that remain the same.

### What We Expect

- Your best effort to do what's best for you and the company
- Be open, honest, and empathetic
- Clearly communicate with the team
- Be understanding and constructive in conversations

### What We DON'T Expect

- You know everything on the first day, or ever for that matter
- You are at your desk at all times
- You work as many hours as possible
- Unquestioning agreement with the way things are

## Time tracking

We use [Harvest](https://b2io.harvestapp.com/) to track time, and there are [nice apps out there for it](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=harvest+apps) to help you track as you work.

Our benchmark number is between 32 and 40 tracked hours, and we operate in good
faith that we are doing the best we can for the company without burning out.

> Question: at what point do we, as a company, start pestering people about
> their hours? Should one make up the time spent in a long lunch that wasn't a
> meeting?

- Not sure what to track to? Ask! (Seriously.)
- We round up or down to the nearest quarter hour to streamline our billing process
- Everyone can see everyone's time.
  - Don't panic, no one's stalking you. Except maybe Tony.
  - Feel free to check out other people's time sheets if you're curious how
    they're tracking things.
- Be honest in tracked time, even if it's short of 40 hours
- If time is not tied to a task number add a description of what you did (future
  you will be pleased)
- When you're not doing client work, track to Internal
  - There are lots of buckets in Internal, check them out
  - It gives you (and the team) insight into your past work

Try to have the day's hours in and rounded to the quarter hour by the end of the day. If we feel like we have a lot of billable work but aren't tracking a high number of billable hours, that
will likely trigger a conversation around team productivity.

### Flex time

Clear time tracking allows for a flexible work schedule without feeling guilty. This allows you to mold your work hours to better fit your personal schedule. For example, if you need to get a haircut, and the best time to schedule that is 2pm on a Thursday, you can make up the hour you miss on
another day (prior or subsequent).

> We trust that we'll make up our time in a timely manner

## Expensing Items

We use Harvest to track our expenses as well as our time. It is very easy and nice.

1. Go to the [expenses tab in Harvest](https://b2io.slack.com/archives/C904HLD5L/p1517848681000679)
2. Click "New Expense"
3. Enter the Project/Category (typically you'll want the categories under
   Internal)
4. Enter the amount and description of your expense
5. _Mark it billable_ (this helps us keep track of which expenses have been paid)
6. Save!

### What qualifies as a thing I can expense?

As a new employee, you'll be expensing a lot of things like hardware and
software (see [Onboarding](./onboarding.md) for more information). It may seem intimidating to
expense so much stuff right off the bat, but don't be alarmed. If you have questions or concerns, please ask someone.

Items that are typically expensed include, but are not limited to:

- software that is necessary to do your job
- computer peripherals
- picking up the food tab for a client
- conference tickets
- items for the office

Again: if you're unsure, ask someone.

## The Office

There are many ways to enter our Columbus office. If you encounter a keypad at any point, you will find [this document](https://b2io.slack.com/archives/C904HLD5L/p1516982371000264) helpful.

We have fancy Jarvis standing desks. Use the up and down arrows on the desk panel to adjust the height. You can save up to 4 presets by adjusting the desk to the desired height and pressing the M button followed by a numbered button.

We have also invested in highly-adjustable, ergonomic Steelcase Gesture chairs for everyone (including remote coworkers).

### Beverages

We take coffee pretty seriously (some of us more than others). Coffee beans and other accoutrement are supplied by the company. Feel free to drink any coffee that has been made, and to make more whenever your caffeine-deprived heart desires.

Aside from coffee, we are also serious about stocking water, fizzy water, pop, and beer.

You can track time while drinking, unless you're drinking margaritas with Jeff - that's definitely not billable.

Grocery shopping is typically the responsibility of one person (Jeff). Let that person know what you'd like to have stocked in the fridge.

## Remote Work

We want you to work wherever you are most comfortable and productive. We strive to make the office that comfortable and productive place, but depending on your personality, location, or responsibilities working elsewhere may make sense on some days or every day. Feel free to work from home, a coffee shop, co-working space, or wherever you feel is best suited for your work.

When working remote please keep the following in mind:

- Communicate your plans with the team so that everybody has shared expectations
- Use best judgement on choice of communication medium: email, Slack, video call / Zoom, or phone call
- Be aware of the limitations of your location and minimize the impact as much as possible
- Time tracking is your friend - it can help you feel more comfortable doing your personal activities without wondering whether or not you've done enough work for the day

## Stand-up

In lieu of an in-person [stand-up meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting), we have a Slack channel ([#standup](https://b2io.slack.com/messages/standup/)) dedicated to the subject. Everyone has a slightly different stand-up message style. Feel free to mimic or create whatever style works best for you.

Posting this information is helpful in a few ways.

- Provides a lo-fi personal todo list
- Gives a general sense of work load
- Provides a reminder of what you worked on in case you forget to track your time

Feel free to mention other people in your status if you want them to read it more closely.

## Meetings

> "I like meetings, as long as they're not a waste of time. Most meetings are a waste of time." - Tony Borres

Definition of a good meeting:

- There is an agenda
- Attendees leave with action items
- Notes are taken

### Weekly Meeting

The entire team meets once a week for lunch (paid for by Base Two) to go over the state of the company. The meeting typically lasts about 1.5 hours. The agenda for each meeting is prepared that morning (in a shared Google Doc) and all team members are welcome to contribute. We cover any combination of the following (incomplete) list of topics:

- Financials
  - Account balances
  - Invoices/billing
  - Profitability
  - Hours
- Project updates
- Business development
- Operations
  - Benefits updates
  - Taxes
  - Profit sharing
- Recruitment
- Marketing
  - Blog
  - Social media
- Team member updates
- Shout-outs
- Action Items

### Quarterly Meetings

Our quarterly meetings are an opportunity for the team to discuss and decide
the trajectory of the company. We take an entire 8-hour day to delve deeper into
topics that we don't have time to cover in weekly meetings. In the past we have
discussed profit sharing, market rates, marketing, and hiring strategies. We
spend part or most of the day offsite, typically at a restaurant. Kim ensures
that we take breaks throughout the day.

### Client Meetings

We don't have much of an office dress code, but when we go on-site for clients (either because we're working from their location or for meetings) we do our best to follow their dress code.

Our goal is to be prepared for client meetings 15 minutes before they begin, regardless of their location. If a client meeting is on-site, make sure you give yourself enough time to get there, get through security (if applicable), and get settled 15 minutes before the meeting begins.

### Remote Meetings

We use [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for remote meetings. You can sign-up and use Zoom for free with your Base Two email address. The free version works great for 1-1 video calls, but is limited to 40 minutes when there are multiple attendees. We have a paid account through info@base2.io, which is useful for client meetings. The password for the paid account can be found in the [credentials document](https://b2io.slack.com/archives/C904HLD5L/p1516982426000280).
