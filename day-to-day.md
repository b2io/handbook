# Day-to-day

## General Expectations

Your work and activities may change day-to-day, but there are general expectations that remain the same.

### We Expect

- That you do the best you can
- Openness, honesty, and empathy
- Clear communication with the team
- Conversations that are both understanding and constructive

### We DON'T Expect

- You to know everything on the first day, or ever
- Being at your desk at all times
- Working as many hours as possible
- Unquestioning agreement with the way things are

## Time tracking

We use [Harvest](https://b2io.harvestapp.com/) to track time.

In order for us to fullfil our obligations to clients and to best work with your team, we ask that you are present at predictable times. Our benchmark number is 40 tracked hours, and we operate in good faith that we are doing the best we can for the company without burning out. However, if you are not meeting expectations for reliable time tracking or attendance, another teammate will reach out to you to ask if the issues impeding reliability are fixable. We don't expect you to be logged in from 9-5, but appropriate and reliable communication is expected when working with a team and for clients. If an employee is assigned to a client project, they are expected to follow the availability of the client.

- Not sure what to track to? Ask! (Seriously.)
- We round up or down to the nearest quarter hour to streamline our billing process
- Everyone can see everyone's time.
  - Don't panic. No one is micromanaging you. Accuracy is important for client billing.
  - Feel free to check out other people's time sheets if you're curious how
    they're tracking things.
- Be honest in tracked time, even if it's short of 40 hours
- If time is not tied to a task number add a description of what you did (future
  you will be pleased)
- When you're not doing client work, track to _Internal_
  - There are lots of buckets in Internal, check them out
  - This gives you (and the team) insight into your past work
- Include details for client work. You do not have to go overboard, but if you are not tracking to a specific development task, try to explain what you spent your time doing.

Try to have the day's hours in and rounded to the quarter hour by the end of the day. If we feel like we have a lot of billable work but aren't tracking a high number of billable hours, that
will likely trigger a conversation around team productivity.

### Time off requests

We use Forecast to request time off. We rely on individuals to alert the rest of the team when they will have absences in a timely manner and in respect of their workload. It is also up to individual employees to adhere to the time off policies of their active client, in terms of communication and tracking.

There is a section of our weekly meeting where you have an opportunity to discuss your time off with the team. It is beneficial that you also keep your work calendar up to date if you plan to be out.

Please also track your time out in Harvest.

### Flex time

A clear system for time tracking allows for a flexible work schedule without feeling guilty. This allows you to mold your work hours to better fit your personal schedule. For example, if you need to get a haircut, and the best time to schedule that is 2pm on a Thursday, you can make up the hour you miss on another day (prior or subsequent). It's important to communicate to your teammates when you'll be away from the keyboard.

> We trust that we'll make up our time in a timely manner

### Professional Development

Self-improvement is important, especially to help achieve personal goals for growth in our industry. Sometimes, we'll be on a project that doesn't directly nurture those goals. If you have urgent concerns about your current project, please let a teammate know so that we can work to [shift you to a new project](./project-placement.md).

That said, often our projects allow for enough flexibility to carve out time to pursue our other goals. This is where Professional Development time comes in!

**If your project's circumstances allow for it, we support 5+ hours of Professional Development time every week.** This time should be used on a daily or weekly basis so that you're still available on your primary project, rather than being pooled and used once a year. This policy is open to discussion, though, so please start a conversation if you have something that you're hoping to pursue that doesn't fit into these constraints. We'll work with you to find a solution that works for everyone.

Sharing is caring ❤️ We encourage you to talk to others about your Professional Development. Your personal growth could be opportunities for more of the team to grow as well. Please share what you're working on in Slack or in our weekly meetings so that other team members might be inspired to join in your journey. Collaboration is one of our greatest strengths at Base Two.

We occasionally have [lightning talks](./glossary.md#lightning-talks) over lunch on Fridays. This is a great way to share some of the things you've learned. Organizing and presenting knowledge is often a helpful way to reinforce the knowledge as well.

## Making Purchases

There are two ways to acquire items for Base Two: use the company card via the "Purchasing Agent" or expense a purchase you have made personally.

Items that are typically bought for the company include, but are not limited to:

- software that is necessary to do your job
- computer peripherals
- picking up the food tab for a client
- conference tickets
- items for the office

If you're unsure about when, how, or if a purchase should be made, ask about it in the #business channel on Slack or ask a teammate.

### Ordering Items via the Purchasing Agent

"Purchasing Agent" is just a fancy title we gave Tony because he has one of the few company credit cards and already handles the expenses. When you need his help ordering something, send him as much detail about the item as possible via Slack (links, make, model, color, etc.).

### Expensing Items

As an employee of Base Two, _you are not required to make any work-related purchases with your own money_. However, if you'd like to order something and expense it, follow these instructions.

_**Note:** Expenses should be submitted within two weeks so that we can better track our cash flow._

1. Go to the [expenses tab in Harvest](https://b2io.slack.com/archives/C904HLD5L/p1517848681000679)
2. Click "New Expense"
3. Enter the Project/Category (typically you'll want the categories under
   Internal)
4. Enter the amount and description of your expense
5. Add a photo of the receipt
6. _Mark it billable_ (this helps us keep track of which expenses have been paid)
7. Save!

## The Office

There are many ways to enter our Columbus office. If you encounter a keypad at any point, you will find [this document](https://b2io.slack.com/archives/C904HLD5L/p1516982371000264) helpful.

We have fancy Jarvis standing desks. Use the up and down arrows on the desk panel to adjust the height. You can save up to 4 presets by adjusting the desk to the desired height and pressing the M button followed by a numbered button.

We have also invested in highly-adjustable, ergonomic Steelcase Gesture chairs for everyone (including remote coworkers).

## Remote Work

We want you to work wherever you are most comfortable and productive. We strive to make the office that comfortable and productive place, but depending on your personality, location, or responsibilities working elsewhere may make sense on some days or every day. Feel free to work from home, a coffee shop, co-working space, or wherever you feel is best suited for your work.

When working remote please keep the following in mind:

- Communicate your plans with the team so that everybody has shared expectations
- Use best judgement on choice of communication medium: email, Slack, video call / Zoom, or phone call
- Be aware of the limitations of your location and minimize the impact as much as possible
- Time tracking is your friend - it can help you feel more comfortable doing your personal activities without wondering whether or not you've done enough work for the day

## Stand-up

In lieu of an in-person [stand-up meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting), we have a Slack channel ([#standup](https://b2io.slack.com/messages/standup/)) dedicated to the subject. Everyone has a slightly different stand-up message style. Feel free to mimic or create whatever style works best for you.

Posting this information is helpful in a few ways.

- Provides a lo-fi personal todo list
- Gives a general sense of work load
- Provides a reminder of what you worked on in case you forget to track your time

Feel free to mention other people in your status if you want them to read it more closely.

## Meetings

> "I like meetings, as long as they're not a waste of time. Most meetings are a waste of time." - Tony Borres

Definition of a good meeting:

- There is an agenda
- Attendees leave with action items
- Notes are taken

### Weekly Meeting

The entire team meets once a week to go over the state of the company. The meeting typically lasts about 1.5 hours. The agenda for each meeting is prepared that morning (in a shared Google Doc) and all team members are welcome to contribute. We cover any combination of the following (incomplete) list of topics:

- Financials
  - Account balances
  - Invoices/billing
  - Profitability
  - Hours
- Project updates
- Business development
- Operations
  - Benefits updates
  - Taxes
  - Profit sharing
- Recruitment
- Marketing
  - Rebranding or updates to website
- Team member scheduling updates
- Shout-outs
- Action Items

### Quarterly Meetings

Our quarterly meetings are an opportunity for the team to discuss and decide
the trajectory of the company. We take an entire 8-hour day to delve deeper into
topics that we don't have time to cover in weekly meetings. In the past we have
discussed profit sharing, market rates, marketing, and hiring strategies. These meetings are subject to the availability of staff and happen less frequently as the staff shifts to be located across the country.

### Client Meetings

We don't have much of an office dress code, but when we go on-site for clients (either because we're working from their location or for meetings) we do our best to follow their dress code.

Our goal is to be prepared for client meetings 15 minutes before they begin, regardless of their location. If a client meeting is on-site, make sure you give yourself enough time to get there, get through security (if applicable), and get settled 15 minutes before the meeting begins.

### Remote Meetings

We use [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for remote meetings. You can sign-up and use Zoom for free with your Base Two email address. The free version works great for 1-1 video calls, but is limited to 40 minutes when there are multiple attendees. We have a paid account through info@base2.io, which is useful for client meetings. The password for the paid account can be found in the [credentials document](https://b2io.slack.com/archives/C904HLD5L/p1516982426000280).

### Base Two Day

Base Two Day is celebrated annually on August 26. It is the anniversary of the founding of Base Two. In the past, this day has been celebrated by hanging out, or participating in Hackathons. Tracking of what has been done on this day is now kept on the team's Google Drive. Discussions around this topic can be found on the [#side-quests](https://join.slack.com/share/zt-h7xz6k8g-FuetGuYYeuKYj34ukKptCg) Slack channel. Base Two Day is also a day when we try to remember to review the handbook!
